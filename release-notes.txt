SonarQube Sonargraph 8 Integration Plugin
=========================================

2.1.6
=====
- Use integration-access version 3.1.7 offering centralized custom metrics support.
 

2.1.5
=====
- Now the SonarQube API 6.7.3 is used.
- Removed a lot of usages of deprecated API classes/methods.
- Updated built-in meta file containing metric and issue information.
- Contains a built-in quality profile.
- Project and module now show issues.
- There is no need to specify an user-defined meta file to cover script-based issue and metrics: 
  - Script issues are now activated (or deactivated) with the single rule 'Sonargraph Integration: Script Issue'.
  - Script metrics are now stored in a properties file and are automatically considered after a restart of 
    the SonarQube server. The properties file is stored at '.sonargraphintegration/metrics.properties'.
    NOTE: When introducing script metrics for the first time a warning message is created when it is 
          necessary to restart the SonarQube server because of a modified metrics.properties file.
